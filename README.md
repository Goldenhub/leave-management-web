# Leave Management System – Frontend

This is the **frontend application** for the Leave Management System.  
It provides the user interface for managing employees, leave requests, and reports.

---

## Overview

The frontend is responsible for:

- User interface and layout
- Form handling and validation
- Fetching and displaying data from the backend
- Role-based UI rendering

It communicates with the backend via REST APIs.

---

## Tech Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- react-hook-form
- Zod
- TanStack Query (React Query)

---

## Forms & Validation

- Forms are built using **react-hook-form**
- Validation is handled with **Zod**
- Select inputs return string values; IDs are coerced to numbers before submission

Passwords are **never exposed** in employee creation forms.  
They are auto-generated by the backend.

---

## Data Fetching

- Data fetching and mutations use **TanStack Query**
- Server state is cached and invalidated on mutations
- UI automatically updates after successful operations

---

## Reports Page

The Reports page displays **summary numbers only**:

- Total employees
- Total departments
- Total leave types
- Total leave requests
- Leave breakdown:
  - Pending
  - Approved
  - Rejected
  - Canceled

No charts are used — only key metrics.

---

```env
